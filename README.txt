Practical Task 2 - Group 56I. OverviewIn this project, we are using three classification methods "RandomForest, SVM, and Neural Network" to predict classes in the dataset "Caltech101".  Based on the performance we achieved, the accuracy of all three classifiers is between 50% and 60% as expected.II. Installation guides, execution and operationa. Installation guides:This program is written in Python and uses libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn and csv. To install this, simply use pip command from terminal:	pip install pandas scikit-learn csvb. ExecutionTo run this program, save it as a .py file and run it using Python in the terminal:	python main.pyc. Operation:The program operates in the following steps:* Data loading and merging: The program reads two csv files "Images.csv" and "EdgeHistogram.csv" and merges them based on the class ID. The merged data is then split into features (X) and labels (y).* Data Splitting: the data is split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 25% of data used for testing.* Model training and evaluation: The program trains and evaluates three different classifiers: RandomForest, SVM, and Neural Network. For each classifier, it uses GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters. The models are then evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.* Storing the results: The confusion matrices and best hyperparameters for each classifier are stored in separate lists.* Exporting the results: The program includes the function, export_to_csv, which writes the confusion matrices and hyperparameters to CSV files. This function is called for each classifier, and the results are saved in files named according to the group number and result number.
